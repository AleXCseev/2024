                Photosynthesis is the most important chemical process that occurs in nature, which enables plants to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars and oxygen.

                <p class="advantage__bottom-text">
                    The irrigation pipe has a very important function. When water flows from the water tank into the irrigation pipe, it drips evenly into the container, simulating the irrigation system. In this way, the water can be properly absorbed by the soil without overflowing from the pot. This type of irrigation can not only accurately supply water, but also reduce evaporation. The loss of water is achieved through evaporation from the soil and plant surface, plus transpiration.
